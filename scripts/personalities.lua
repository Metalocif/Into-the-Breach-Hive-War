-- Most dialogs roll a dice for target like so:
-- 40% chance for Hive Warrior to speak
-- 20% chance for Pilot 1 to speak
-- 20% chance for Pilot 2 to speak
-- 20% chance for Pilot 3 to speak
-- If the rolled mech has no pilot, the Hive Warrior will speak (because in order to get Vek to talk, I have to overwrite the AI Pilot's dialog lines)
-- There are a few exceptions:
-- The Wolf_HW_Breach dialog has a 33% chance for each pilot and the AI Pilot is allowed to speak
-- The Wolf_HW_Retreat dialog will only target the Hive Warrior itself, because the pilots have the standard "vek killed" dialog
-- The Wolf_HW_Death dialog will only target the Hive Warrior itself, because the pilots have the standard "vek killed" dialog
-- The Wolf_HW_Draw dialog will only target the Hive Warrior itself, because the pilots have the standard "mission over" dialog
